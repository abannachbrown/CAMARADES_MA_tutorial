## Welcome

This web-based tutorial complements the workshop: <a href="https://www.bihealth.org/en/translation/innovation-enabler/quest-center/mission-approaches/education-and-training/how-to-conduct-a-preclinical-animal-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Introduction to Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis of Animal Studies 
</a>

<br>
We will use the R programming language to work through a meta-analysis of animal data but you do not need any previous experience with R to complete the tutorial.
<br>

For the tutorial, we will use example data from the publication:

<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12975-016-0489-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

  McCann SK, Cramond F, Macleod MR *et al*. Systematic Review and 
  Meta-Analysis of the Efficacy of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist in 
  Animal Models of Stroke: an Update. *Translational Stroke Research* 7, 395â€“406 (2016).

</a></p>

**Background information on the data set: **
<br>
Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) is an anti-inflammatory protein used clinically to treat rheumatoid arthritis and is considered a promising candidate therapy for stroke. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to assess the efficacy of IL-1RA in animal models of ischaemic stroke, the range of conditions under which efficacy has been tested, and whether the data appear to be confounded due to reported study quality and publication bias. The outcomes we will assess in this tutorial are post-stroke infarct volume (brain damage), mortality, and neurobehavioural outcomes e.g. motor deficits, in IL-1RA-treated vs. control animals.



## Overview{#meta-analysis}

We will analyse the effect of IL-1RA treatment on each of our three outcomes (infarct volume, mortality, and neurobehaviour) separately. 

For infarct volume and mortality, all of the R code is provided and you just need to click on the blue **Run Code** button on the top right of each code chunk to see the results.

For neurobehaviour, you will have the opportunity to write your own code to analyse the data set provided.

Within each section there are multiple-choice questions to test your understanding. If you answer a question incorrectly the first time, you can click the orange **Try Again** button.

The tutorial comprises five main sections:
<br>

**1.  Meta-analysis of continuous data** (infarct volume)

In the first section of the tutorial we will cover the steps to meta-analyse continuous data: 
<br>
  1.1  Calculating effect sizes
<br>
  1.2  Performing a random effects meta-analysis
<br>
  1.3  Exploring heterogeneity

**2.  Meta-analysis of binary data** (mortality)

In the second section of the tutorial we will look at the binary outcome, mortality, calculate effect sizes and perform a random effects meta-analysis.

**3.  Test your skills: meta-analysis** (neurobehaviour)

In this section we provide you with the data set describing neurobehavioural outcomes (continuous data) and prompts to insert code to analyse the data. 

You can copy and edit the code provided in Part 1 to perform the analyses. If you are unsure about what code to use, click on the **Hint(s)** buttons. You can compare your results to those in the paper, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12975-016-0489-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McCann *et al*. 2016</a>. 

**4.  Small study effects** (infarct volume)

In this section we will assess the infarct volume data set for the presence of small study effects using funnel plot-based methods including Egger's regression and trim and fill.

**5.  Test your skills: small study effects** (neurobehaviour)

Lastly, you will have the opportunity to apply your skills in assessing small study effects using the neurobehavioural data set.

## 1.  Meta-analysis of continuous data{#set-up}

```{r ex1_1_setup_1, include = FALSE}
infarctVol <- read.csv("./IL1-RA_InfarctVolume_Part1.1-2.csv", 
                       fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM"
                       )
```

First, let's load the data we will use for the meta-analysis of infarct volume:

```{r ex1_1_1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_1"}
infarctVol <- read.csv("IL1-RA_InfarctVolume_Part1.1-2.csv", 
                       fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")
```

<br>
It is good practice to take a look at the data you import to make sure there are no errors. After you run the next section of code, the imported data will open in a table below:

```{r ex1_1_2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_1"}
head(infarctVol, n=76)
```

```{r quiz1_1_1, echo=FALSE}
# Have a look at the column headings: 
# 
# * What does each row represent?
# * Which columns are the control group data (mean, standard deviation, N)?
# * Which columns are the intervention group data?
# * What other data have been recorded for each experiment?

quiz(caption = "Examine the data set and answer the following:",
  question("What does each row represent?",
    answer("A single publication"),
    answer("A single meta-analysis"),
    answer("A single group of animals involved in an experiment"),
    answer("A single experiment with data for a control group and a treatment group", correct = TRUE),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Which columns are the control group data (mean, standard deviation, N)?",
    answer("Mean.in.control.group; SD.in.control.group; True.No.of.C"),
    answer("Mean.in.control.group; SD.in.treatment.group; Number.in.treatment.group"),
    answer("Mean.in.treatment.group; Type.of.Ischaemia; TreatmentGroupsPerControl"),
    answer("Mean.in.control.group; SD.in.control.group; Number.in.control.group", correct = TRUE),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Which columns are the intervention group data (mean, standard deviation, N)?",
    answer("Mean.in.treatment.group; SD.in.control.group; True.No.of.C"),
    answer("Mean.in.treatment.group; SD.in.treatment.group; Number.in.treatment.group", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Mean.in.treatment.group; SD.in.treatment.group; TreatmentGroupsPerControl"),
    answer("Mean.in.treatment.group; SD.in.treatment.group; True.No.of.C"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("What other data have been recorded for each experiment?",
    answer("The method of induction of MCAo; the type of ischaemia; the dose of IL-1RA; the sex of the animals", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The method of induction of MCAo; the age of the animals; the dose of IL-1RA; the sex of the animals"),
    answer("The type of ischaemia; the dose of IL-1RA; random allocation to group; the weight of the animals"),
    answer("Random allocation to group; blinded assessment of outcome; the time of assessment; the number of animals that suffered a haemorrhage "),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```


## 1.1  Calculating effect sizes

Now we will calculate an effect size for each experiment in the data set. An <a href="https://www.camarades.de/meta-analysis.html#step-1.-calculate-effect-size" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">effect size</a> is a measure of the difference between two experimental cohorts.

<br>
Infarct volume is a continuous variable and we will calculate a [normalised mean difference](https://www.camarades.de/meta-analysis.html#continuous){target="_blank"} (NMD) effect size using the control (vehicle-treated) and treatment (IL-1RA-treated) groups. The effect size is expressed as the proportional or percentage improvement in the treatment group compared with the control group. NMD is not widely used in clinical systematic reviews and there is no NMD effect size calculator included in the meta-analysis package we are using. Therefore, we will calculate NMD effect sizes manually.

</br>
Note that green text following a hash symbol (#) in the code chunk is not read by R but simply provides a description of the code to make it easier to follow.

</br>
```{r ex1_1_setup_2, include = FALSE}
infarctVol <- read.csv("IL1-RA_InfarctVolume_Part1.1-2.csv", 
                         fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")

# specify the column that contains the mean of the control group
mCi <-  infarctVol$Mean.in.control.group
# specify the column that contains the standard deviation of the control group 
sdCi <- infarctVol$SD.in.control.group 
# specify the column that contains the number of animals in the control group
nCi <- infarctVol$True.No.of.C 
# specify the column that contains to mean of the treatment group 
mTi <- infarctVol$Mean.in.treatment.group
# specify the column that contains the standard deviation of the treatment group 
sdTi <- infarctVol$SD.in.treatment.group 
# specify the column that contains the number of animals in the treatment group
nTi <- infarctVol$Number.in.treatment.group

# calculate an NMD effect size for each experiment 
ESi <- (mCi - mTi) / mCi * 100

# add the effect size data as a new column in the infarctVol data set
infarctVol <- cbind(infarctVol, ESi)  
```

First, specify the columns in the data set that contain the mean, standard deviation, and number of animals in the **control** group:

```{r ex1_1_3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_2", exercise.lines=9}
# save the group means to a variable called mCi
mCi <- infarctVol$Mean.in.control.group

# save the group standard deviations to a variable called sdCi 
sdCi <- infarctVol$SD.in.control.group

# save the number of animals to a variable called nCi
nCi <- infarctVol$True.No.of.C 
```


...and the columns that contain the mean, standard deviation, and number of animals in the **treatment** group:

```{r ex1_1_4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_2", exercise.lines=9}
# save the group means to a variable called mTi
mTi <- infarctVol$Mean.in.treatment.group

# save the group standard deviations to a variable called sdTi 
sdTi <- infarctVol$SD.in.treatment.group 

# save the number of animals to a variable called nTi
nTi <- infarctVol$Number.in.treatment.group
```

You have just created six new variables that you will use to calculate effect sizes. You can view variables to check that they contain the correct data. For example, running the following section of code will show you the list of values in the mCi variable (data for the mean in the control group). This should match the corresponding column in the data set. You can edit this code to view the other variables if you wish.

```{r ex1_1_4_1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_2", exercise.lines=3}

mCi
```


Now let's calculate an NMD effect size for each experiment (ESi) and add the effect size data as a new column in the infarctVol data set. The function "cbind" takes a table of data and binds a new column to the right side. Remember: each variable in this equation is a list of numbers, with each entry corresponding to a single experiment.

<br> 
**Note**: we are using a truncated form of the NMD equation here because we know that a sham animal that has not suffered a stroke will have no infarct. This reduces the corresponding parts of the NMD equation to zero; see the <a href="http://camarades.de/meta-analysis.html#continuous" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> CAMARADES wiki page</a> for more information.

```{r ex1_1_5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_2", exercise.lines=6}
# calculate the NMD effect size for each experiment and save the results to the ESi variable
ESi <- (mCi - mTi) / mCi * 100

# add the effect size data as a new column
infarctVol <- cbind(infarctVol, ESi) 
```

```{r ex1_1_setup_3, include = FALSE}
infarctVol <- read.csv("IL1-RA_InfarctVolume_Part1.1-2.csv", 
                         fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")

# specify the column that contains the mean of the control group
mCi <-  infarctVol$Mean.in.control.group
# specify the column that contains the standard deviation of the control group 
sdCi <- infarctVol$SD.in.control.group 
# specify the column that contains the number of animals in the control group
nCi <- infarctVol$True.No.of.C 
# specify the column that contains to mean of the treatment group 
mTi <- infarctVol$Mean.in.treatment.group
# specify the column that contains the standard deviation of the treatment group 
sdTi <- infarctVol$SD.in.treatment.group 
# specify the column that contains the number of animals in the treatment group
nTi <- infarctVol$Number.in.treatment.group

# calculate an NMD effect size for each experiment 
ESi <- (mCi - mTi) / mCi * 100

# add the effect size data as a new column in the infarctVol data set
infarctVol <- cbind(infarctVol, ESi)  

# calculate an NMD standard deviation for each group
nsdCi <- sdCi / mCi * 100 # control group
nsdTi <- sdTi / mCi * 100 # treatment group

# calculate an NMD standard error for each experiment 
SEi <- sqrt((nsdCi^2) / nCi + (nsdTi^2) / nTi)

# add the standard error data as a new column in the infarctVol data set
infarctVol <- cbind(infarctVol, SEi)  

infarctVolMA <- metagen(
  ESi,  # specify the variable that contains the effect size for each experiment 
  SEi,  # specify the variable that contains the standard error for each experiment
  data = infarctVol,  # specify the data set
  studlab = Study.ID,  # specify the study labels
  comb.random = TRUE,  # specify a random effects model
  method.tau = "REML",  # specify which method is used to estimate the between-study variance Ï„^: restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimator
 )

# table(infarctVol$Blinded.Induction.of.Ischaemia)  # check the different levels of the variable and number of experiments in each
 
infarctVolBlind <- metareg(
  infarctVolMA,  # specify the meta-analysis
  ~ Blinded.Induction.of.Ischaemia  # specify the experimental variable of interest 
)   

infarctVol2 <- subset(
  infarctVol,  # specify the data to subset
  !(Drug.delivery.mode %in%  # specify the relevant variable
      c("Transgenic", "Vector", "IL-1RA Tg BM cells", "IL-1 RA Tg BM cells"))  # specify the variable levels to exclude from analysis  
)  

infarctVolMA2 <- metagen(
  ESi,  # specify the variable that contains the effect size for each experiment 
  SEi,  # specify the variable that contains the standard error for each experiment
  data = infarctVol2,  # specify the data set
  studlab = Study.ID,  # specify the study labels
  comb.random = TRUE,  # specify a random effects model
  method.tau = "REML",  # specify which method is used to estimate the between-study variance Ï„^2, restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimator
)

infarctVolRoute <- metareg(
  infarctVolMA2,   # specify the meta-analysis
  ~ factor(Route.of.Drug.Delivery)  # specify the experimental variable of interest
) 

infarctVolSpecies <- metareg(
  infarctVolMA2,   # specify the meta-analysis
  ~ factor(Species)   # specify the experimental variable of interest
)   

infarctVol3 <- subset(
 infarctVol2,  # specify the data to subset 
 Location.of.drug.administration %in%  # specify the relevant variable
   "Central"  # specify the experiments to include in the analysis
) 

infarctVolMA3 <-  metagen(
  ESi,  # specify the variable that contains the effect size for each experiment 
  SEi,  # specify the variable that contains the standard error for each experiment
  data = infarctVol3,  # specify the data set
  studlab = Study.ID,  # specify the study labels
  comb.random = TRUE,  # specify a random effects model
  method.tau = "REML",  # specify which method is used to estimate the between-study variance Ï„^2, restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimator
)

infarctVolDose <- metareg(
 infarctVolMA3,  # specify the meta-analysis 
 ~ "Dose"   # specify the experimental variable of interest
)  

infarctVolTrim <- trimfill(
  # specify the meta-analysis to plot
  infarctVolMA,
  
  # specify the side of the plot where missing studies are expected
  left = TRUE,  
  
  # plot the random effects estimate
  comb.random = TRUE,  
  
  # specify which method is used to estimate the between-study variance Ï„^2,   restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimator
  method.tau = "REML"  
)           
```

<br>
Next, we calculate the NMD standard deviation for each group:

```{r ex1_1_6, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3", exercise.lines=6}
# control group
nsdCi <- sdCi / mCi * 100 

# treatment group
nsdTi <- sdTi / mCi * 100 
```


We will now calculate the NMD standard error for each experiment (SEi) and add the standard error data as a new column in the infarctVol data set:

```{r ex1_1_7, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3", exercise.lines=6}
# calculate the NMD standard error
SEi <- sqrt((nsdCi^2) / nCi + (nsdTi^2) / nTi)

# add the standard error data as a new column in the table
infarctVol <- cbind(infarctVol, SEi)   
```


Check that your new columns have been added to the right hand side of the data set:

```{r ex1_1_8, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3"}
head(infarctVol)
```


## 1.2  Random effects meta-analysis

### Building the meta-analysis model
Next we combine the individual effect sizes with meta-analysis using the function "metagen". This gives us an overall summary estimate of the effect of IL-1RA on infarct volume, compared to control. Note that to begin with, we will print both the random effects and fixed effect estimates so that we can compare the results:

```{r ex1_1_9, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3",  exercise.lines=23}
infarctVolMA <- metagen(
  # specify the variable that contains the effect size for each experiment
  ESi,   
  
  # specify the variable that contains the standard error for each experiment
  SEi,  
  
  # specify the data set
  data = infarctVol,  
  
  # specify the study labels
  studlab = Study.ID,  
  
  # specify a random effects model
  comb.random = TRUE, 
  
  # specify a fixed effect model
  comb.fixed = TRUE,
  
  # specify which method is used to estimate the between-study variance, Ï„^2: restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimator
  method.tau = "REML"  
)
``` 

View the results of the meta-analysis:

```{r ex1_1_10, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3"}
infarctVolMA   
```

```{r quiz1_1_2, echo=FALSE}

### Forest plot

A <a href="https://www.camarades.de/meta-analysis.html#step-5.-interpret-the-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forest plot</a> is a way to visualise the effect size and confidence interval for each individual study in a meta-analysis, it is created using the function "forest":

```{r ex1_1_11, fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 18, out.width="100%", out.height="100%", scaled = TRUE, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3", exercise.lines=44}

## 1.3 Exploring heterogeneity

Here we will <a href="http://www.camarades.de/meta-analysis.html#step-3.-investigate-heterogeneity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">investigate patterns of heterogeneity</a> in our data and what might be causing them. Different study-level variables (e.g. species) can be added to a meta-regression model to predict differences in true effect sizes. We will investigate four variables in different subsets of the infarct volume data set, as performed in the publication <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12975-016-0489-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McCann et al. (2016)</a>. For this analysis we will use the function "metareg".

### Meta-regression: blinding

Investigate the variable "Blinded induction of ischaemia" in the complete data set.

This variable addresses whether authors reported blinding of researchers during stroke induction in the animals. Blinding is an important variable when assessing risks of bias:

```{r ex1_2_1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3", exercise.lines=14}
# check the different levels of the variable and number of experiments in each
table(infarctVol$Blinded.Induction.of.Ischaemia)  

infarctVolBlind <- metareg(
  # specify the meta-analysis
  infarctVolMA,  
  
  # specify the experimental variable of interest
  ~ Blinded.Induction.of.Ischaemia   
)  

# view the meta-regression
infarctVolBlind
```

<br>


You can create a bar chart of these results using the code below. Do not worry about trying to understand the code at this stage, it is very long!

### Meta-regression: route of drug delivery

Investigate the variable "Route of drug delivery " in the subset of data where the drug delivery mode is "Protein".

In this data set IL-1RA was administered using several different delivery modes (column "Drug.delivery.mode"). We will restrict subsequent analyses to those experiments where IL-1RA was delivered in protein form, due to uncertainty around the timing and effective dose achieved in transgenic and transfection studies (the alternative drug delivery modes).

Route of drug delivery refers to how IL-1RA was administered e.g. intravenous, subcutaneous. Several different methods were used in these experiments, which may have an influence on effect sizes.

First we will create a new data set including only the protein studies using the function "subset":

```{r ex1_2_2_1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3", exercise.lines=14}
infarctVol2 <- subset(
  # specify the data to subset
  infarctVol,  
  
  # specify the relevant variable
  !(Drug.delivery.mode %in%  
      
      # specify the variable levels to exclude from analysis  
      c("Transgenic", "Vector", "IL-1RA Tg BM cells", "IL-1 RA Tg BM cells"))  
) 

# View the new data subset
head(infarctVol2, n=65)
```

Have a look at the table above and check that the only studies remaining are those where the drug delivery mode is "Protein".

Next we will run a meta-analysis on this subset of the data: 

```{r ex1_2_2_2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3", exercise.lines=27}
infarctVolMA2 <- metagen(
  # specify the variable that contains the effect size for each experiment 
  ESi,  
  
  # specify the variable that contains the standard error for each experiment
  SEi,  
  
  # specify the data set
  data = infarctVol2,  
  
  # specify the study labels
  studlab = Study.ID,  
  
  # specify a random effects model
  comb.random = TRUE,  
  
  # specify that the fixed effect estimate should not be printed
  comb.fixed = FALSE,
  
  # specify which method is used to estimate the between-study variance Ï„^2, restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimator
  method.tau = "REML",  
)

# view the results of the meta-analysis 
infarctVolMA2   
```

<br>

Now check the variable data and perform the meta-regression investigating "Route of drug delivery":

```{r ex1_2_2_3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3"}
# check the different delivery routes and number of experiments using each
table(infarctVol2$Route.of.Drug.Delivery)
 
infarctVolRoute <- metareg(
  # specify the meta-analysis
  infarctVolMA2,   
  
  # specify the experimental variable of interest
  ~ factor(Route.of.Drug.Delivery)  
)  
     
# view the results of the meta-regression 
infarctVolRoute  

```

```{r quiz1_2_2, echo=FALSE}

# Questions:
# 
# * How many different drug delivery routes are there and how are the data distributed across these routes?

# * Which routes might be the most clinically relevant? 
#   - How do their effect sizes compare to less clinically relevant routes?
# * How have the heterogeneity estimates changed when compared with infarctVolMA2?
# * How much heterogeneity is accounted for by the route of drug delivery?
  
quiz(caption = "Questions:",
  question("How many different drug delivery routes are there and how are the data distributed across these routes?",
    answer("There are five drug delivery routes and the data are unevenly distributed", correct = TRUE),
    answer("There are five drug delivery routes and the data are evenly distributed"),

  ),

    answer("Administration into the brain (ICerebVentricular, Stereotactic) beacuse these routes are more direct"),
    answer("Peripheral administration (SubCut, IVenous) because these routes are more often used in human patients", correct = TRUE),
    answer("ICerebVentricular (directly into the brain) because it has the highest efficacy"),
    answer("None of these routes are used clinically"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("How much heterogeneity is accounted for by the route of drug delivery?",
    answer("tau^2 and I^2 are reduced and R^2 is 43.3% meaning a large portion of the heterogeneity in this data set is accounted for by the route of drug delivery", correct = TRUE),
    answer("There is still significant residual heterogeneity so the route of drug delivery does not account for a significant portion of the heterogeneity"),
    answer("tau^2 and I^2 are reduced but R^2 is under 50% so route of drug delivery is not a significant source of heterogeneity"),
    answer("tau^2 , I^2 , and R^2 are all high so route of drug delivery does not account for much heterogeneity"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```


### Meta-regression: species

Investigate the variable "Species" in the subset of data where the drug delivery mode is "Protein"
  
Using the same data set (infarctVol2) and meta-analysis (infarctVolMA2), now investigate whether animal species is a source of heterogeneity:

```{r ex1_2_3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3"}
table(infarctVol2$Species)

infarctVolSpecies <- metareg(
  
  # specify the meta-analysis
  infarctVolMA2,   
  
  # specify the experimental variable of interest
  ~ factor(Species)   
)   

# view the results of the meta-regression
infarctVolSpecies    
```

```{r quiz1_2_3, echo=FALSE}

# Questions:
# 
# * What different species have been used in these experiments and how are the data distributed?
# * Is species a significant source of heterogeneity in the data set?
# * What do these results indicate about the generalisability, or external validity, of the data?
  
quiz(caption = "Questions:",
  question("Is species a significant source of heterogeneity in the data set?",
    answer("Yes, p-val < .0001"),
    answer("No, p-val = 0.3303", correct = TRUE),
    answer("It depends at what level the p-value is considered statistically significant"),
    answer("Yes, R^2 = 1.25%"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("What do these results indicate about the generalisability, or external validity, of the data?",
    answer("There is no effect of species, which might indicate generalisability of results across other species", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Mice and rats always react the same way to drugs so we do not know how results will generalise to other species"),
    answer("These results do not tell us anything about generalisabilty"),
    answer("There is no effect of species so generalisability is poor"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```


### Meta-regresion: dose of IL-1RA

Investigate the variable "Dose" in the subset of data where the drug delivery mode is "Protein" and the location of administration is "Central".

Now let's check if the dose of IL1-RA is associated with effect size differences (i.e. is there a dose response) using only data where the drug was administered centrally (i.e. directly into the brain) and excluding data where the drug was administered peripherally. 

First we will create a new data set including only the centrally-administered protein studies, again using the function "subset":

```{r ex1_2_4_1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3"}
infarctVol3 <- subset(
  # specify the data to subset
  infarctVol2,   
  
  # specify the relevant variable
  Location.of.drug.administration %in%  
    
    # specify the experiments to include in the analysis
    "Central"  
)     

# View the new data subset
head(infarctVol3, n=20)  
```

Have a look at the table above and check that the only studies remaining are those where the location of drug administration is "Central".

Next run a meta-analysis on this new data set:

```{r ex1_2_4_2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3", exercise.lines=24}
infarctVolMA3 <-  metagen(
  # specify the variable that contains the effect size for each experiment
  ESi,  
  
  # specify the variable that contains the standard error for each experiment
  SEi,  
  
  # specify the data set
  data = infarctVol3,  
  
  # specify the study labels
  studlab = Study.ID,  
  
  # specify a random effects model
  comb.random = TRUE,  
  
  # specify that the fixed effect estimate should not be printed
  comb.fixed = FALSE,
  
  # specify which method is used to estimate the between-study variance Ï„^2, restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimator
  method.tau = "REML",  
)

# view the results of the meta-analysis 
infarctVolMA3   
```

Finally, perform the meta-regression investigating "Dose":

```{r ex1_2_4_3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3"}
infarctVolDose <- metareg(
  # specify the meta-analysis
  infarctVolMA3,   
  
  # specify the experimental variable of interest
  ~ "Dose"   
)  
 
# view the results of the meta-regression
infarctVolDose  
```

<br>

To graph a continuous variable we can use a bubble plot:

```{r ex1_2_4_4, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3"}
# specify the meta-regression analysis to plot 
bubble(infarctVolDose, 
       
  # specify the x axis label 
  xlab = "IL1-RA dose (Âµg)", 
  
  # specify the y axis label
  ylab = "NMD (% reduction in infarct volume)"  
)  
```

```{r quiz1_2_4, echo=FALSE}

# Questions:
# 
# * What is the relationship between the effect size and dose of IL-1RA?
# * How much heterogeneity is accounted for by dose?
# * In the bubble plot, what does the size of the circles represent?
  
quiz(caption = "Questions:",
  question("What is the relationship between the effect size and dose of IL-1RA?",
    answer("For each unit increase in IL-1RA dose, infarct volume is reduced by 2.16%", correct = TRUE),
    answer("As the reduction in infarct volume increases, the dose of IL-1Ra administered decreases"),
    answer("As the infarct volume reduction decreases, the dose of IL-1RA administered increases"),
    answer("For each 2.16ug dose increase in IL-1RA, infarct volume is reduced by 1.00% "),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("How much heterogeneity is accounted for by dose?",
    answer("45.17%", correct = TRUE),
    answer("3.32%"),
    answer("A non-significant amount"),
    answer("A significant amount, p-val < .0001"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("In the bubble plot, what does the size of the circles represent?",
    answer("The weights from the random effects meta-regression model", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The weights from the fixed effect meta-regression model"),
    answer("The number of animals in each study"),
    answer("The dose of IL-1RA administered in each study"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```


## 2.  Meta-analysis of binary data

```{r ex1_3_setup, include = FALSE}
mortality <- read.csv("IL-1RA_Mortality_Part1.3.csv", 
                      fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")

mortalityMA <- metabin(
  event.e = NumberAffectdByOutcomeMeasureInTreatmentGroup,  # specify the number of events in experimental group
  n.e = NumberInTreatmentGroup,  #specify the number of observations in the experimental group
  event.c = NumberAffectdByOutcomeMeasureInControlGroup,  # specify the number of events in control group
  n.c = NumberInControlGroup,  #specify the number of observations in the control group
  allstudies = TRUE,  # specify that the meta-analysis should include studies with zero or all events in both groups
  studlab = Study.ID,   # specify the study labels
  data = mortality,    # specify the data set
  method.tau = "REML",  # specify which method is used to estimate the between-study variance Ï„^2, restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimator
  sm = "OR",  # specify the summary measure, "OR" = odds ratio
  comb.random = TRUE,  # specify a random effects model
 )
```

We will now move on to meta-analyse our second outcome of interest, mortality. Mortality is a binary outcome (animals are dead or alive) so we need to use an effect size appropriate for this data type. There are several such effect sizes but we will use an **odds ratio**, which represents the odds that our outcome (death) will occur given IL-1RA treatment, compared to the odds of our outcome occurring in the absence treatment (control).

For this exercise, we will use the function "metabin" for meta-analysis of binary outcomes. "metabin" will calculate an odds ratio effect size directly if we provide the number of animals and events (deaths) in the treatment and control groups, so there is no need to manually calculate these values as we did for NMD effect sizes above.

### Load and view the data

```{r ex1_3_1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_3_setup"}
mortality <- read.csv("IL-1RA_Mortality_Part1.3.csv", 
                      fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")

head(mortality, n=10)
```

Take a look at the table above and compare the outcome data to that from the infarct volume (continuous) data above.

```{r quiz1_3_1, echo=FALSE}

# Questions:
# 
# * How do these data differ from the infarct volume data used above?
  
quiz(caption = "Question:",
  question("How do these data differ from the infarct volume data used above?",
    answer("Instead of group means and standard deviations, the number affected by the event (death) is recorded", correct = TRUE),
    answer("There are fewer rows in the mortality data but no difference in the type of data recorded"),
    answer("There are no means and standard deviations in the mortality data but there are medians and interquartile ranges recorded instead"),
    answer("In addition to means and standard deviations, there is event data recorded in the mortality data set"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```


### Meta-analysis

Now perform a meta-analysis using the function "metabin": 

```{r ex1_3_2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_3_setup", exercise.lines=34}
mortalityMA <- metabin(
  # specify the number of events in experimental group
  event.e = NumberAffectdByOutcomeMeasureInTreatmentGroup,
  
  # specify the number of observations in the experimental group
  n.e = NumberInTreatmentGroup, 
  
  # specify the number of events in control group
  event.c = NumberAffectdByOutcomeMeasureInControlGroup,

  mortalityMA    
```

    answer("The summary OR is close to 1 and the 95%-CI crosses 1, there is no evidence that IL-1RA affects mortality", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The summary OR is close to 1 and the 95%-CI does not cross 0 so there is evidence that IL-1RA affects mortality"),

  ),
  question("How much heterogeneity is in the data set?",
    answer("There is no statistical heterogeneity detected in the data set", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The upper confidence interval for I^2 is 62.4% so there might be a large amount of heterogeneity"),
    answer("t^2 and I^2 = 0 but the included studies are imprecise so we are sure there is undetected heterogeneity in the data set"),
    answer("The test of heterogeneity has a very large p-value so there cannot be any heterogeneity in the data set"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```


### Forest plot

Next we will create a forest plot of the mortality data using the function "forest":

```{r ex1_3_3, fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 4, out.width="100%", out.height="100%", scaled = TRUE, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_3_setup", exercise.lines=32}
mortalityFor <- forest(
 # specify the meta-analysis to plot
 mortalityMA,  
 
 # sort the data according to effect size
 sortvar = TE,   
 
 # do not plot the fixed effect estimate
 comb.fixed = FALSE,  
 
 # plot the random effects estimate
 comb.random = TRUE,  
 
 # specify the effect size label
 smlab = "Odds ratio",  
 
 # specify the graph label on right side of plot
 label.right = "Favours Control",
 
 # specify the graph label on left side of plot
 label.left = "Favours IL-1RA",  
 
 # specify the size of text (in points)
 fontsize = 11,  
 
 # specify minimal number of significant digits for treatment effects
 digits = 2, 
 
 # specify minimal number of significant digits for standard errors
 digits.se = 2  
)  
```

```{r quiz1_3_3, echo=FALSE}

# Questions:
# 
# * How is the forest plot different from the plot in Part 1.1?
# * Interpret the point estimates from Garcia1995a and Maysami2015b
# * How confident would you be in the effect of IL-1RA on mortality based on these results?
  
quiz(caption = "Questions:",
  question("How is the forest plot different from the plot we created using the infarct volume data set?",
    answer("The number of events are printed and the weights are fixed effect"),
    answer("The x axis is on a log scale and the line of no effect is at x = 1", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The effect size is OR instead of SMD"),
    answer("The number of animals who did not experience an event is printed and the x axis is on a log scale"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Interpret the point estimates from Garcia1995a and Maysami2015b",
    answer("In both studies there is no effect of IL-1RA on mortality because the confidence intervals cross 1", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The odds of mortality in the IL-1RA treated group are 0.46 and 2.14 that of the control group in Garcia1995a and Maysami2015b, respectively"),
    answer("With IL-1RA treatment, there is increased occurance of mortality in Garcia1995a and decreased occurance of mortality in Maysami2015b"),
    answer("With IL-1RA treatment, there is decreased occurance of mortality in Garcia1995a and increased occurance of mortality in Maysami2015b"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```


## 3.  Test your skills: meta-analysis 

Now you can explore the neurobehavioural outcomes data set by writing your own code. We have only included experiments where IL-1RA was administered in protein form and motor / sensory outcomes were assessed.

In this data set, a normalised mean difference effect size (column ESi) and standard error (column SEi) have already been calculated for each experiment. 

You can edit the code we used to analyse the infarct volume data above and compare your results to those in the paper, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12975-016-0489-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McCann *et al*. 2016</a>. If you are unsure about what code to use, click on the **Hint(s)** buttons. 

Start by loading and viewing the data set:

```{r ex1_4_setup, include = FALSE}
neurobeh <- read.csv("IL1-RA_Neurobehaviour_Part1.4.csv", fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")

```

```{r ex1_4_1, fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 8, out.width="100%", out.height="100%", scaled = TRUE, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_4_setup", exercise.lines=10}
# load and view the data set "IL1-RA_Neurobehaviour_Part1.4.csv" using the function read.csv().


```


```{r ex1_4_2_setup, include = FALSE}
neurobeh <- read.csv("IL1-RA_Neurobehaviour_Part1.4.csv", fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")

neurobehMA <- metagen(
#  # specify the variable that contains the effect size for each 
#  # experiment 
  ESi,  
#  
#  # specify the variable that contains the standard error for each 
#  # experiment
  SEi,  
#  
#  # specify the data set
  data = neurobeh,  
#  
#  # specify the study labels
  studlab = Study.ID,  
#  
#  # specify a random effects model
  comb.random = TRUE,  
#  
  # specify which method is used to estimate the between-study 
  # variance Ï„^2, restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimator
  method.tau = "REML"  
)
#
#neurobehFor <- forest(
#  # specify the meta-analysis to plot
#  neurobehMA,  
#  
#  # sort the data according to effect size
#  sortvar = TE,   
#  
#  # do not plot the fixed effect estimate
#  comb.fixed = FALSE,  
#  
#  # plot the random effects estimate
#  comb.random = TRUE,  
#  
#  # specify the labels for the left hand plot columns
#  leftlabs = c("Study", "ES", "SE"),  
#  
#  # specify the x axis label
#  xlab = "NMD (% reduction in infarct volume)",  
#  
#  # specify the effect size label
#  smlab = "NMD",  
#  
#  # specify the graph label on right side of plot
#  label.right = "Favours IL-1RA",  
#  
#  # specify the graph label on left side of plot
#  label.left = "Favours Control",  
#  
#  # specify the x axis limits
#  xlim = c(-150,150),  
#  
#  # specify the size of text (in points)
#  fontsize = 10,  
#  
#  # specify the width of the plotting region
#  plotwidth = "10cm",  
#  
#  # specify minimal number of significant digits for treatment effects
#  digits = 1,  
#  
#  # specify minimal number of significant digits for standard errors
#  digits.se = 1  
#)
```

```{r ex1_4_1-hint-1}
# load and view the data set "IL1-RA_Neurobehaviour_Part1.4.csv" using the function read.csv().
neurobeh <- read.csv("IL1-RA_Neurobehaviour_Part1.4.csv", fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")

head(neurobeh)
```


Then, perform a random effects meta-analysis:
```{r ex1_4_2, fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 8, out.width="100%", out.height="100%", scaled = TRUE, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_4_setup", exercise.lines=30}


# use the function "metagen()"


```


```{r ex1_4_2-hint}
# Perform a random effects meta-analysis using the function "metagen".
neurobehMA <- metagen(
  # specify the variable that contains the effect size for each experiment 
  ESi,  
  
  # specify the variable that contains the standard error for each experiment
  SEi,
  
  # specify the data set
  data = neurobeh,  
  
  # specify the study labels
  studlab = Study.ID,  
  
  # specify a random effects model
  comb.random = TRUE,  
  
  # specify not to print the fixed effect model
  comb.fixed = FALSE,
  
  # specify which method is used to estimate the between-study variance Ï„^2, restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimator
  method.tau = "REML"  
)

 # view the meta-analysis
neurobehMA
```

Next, visualise the results of the meta-analysis with a forest plot: 
```{r ex1_4_3, fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 8, out.width="100%", out.height="100%", scaled = TRUE, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_4_2_setup", exercise.lines=20}

# Create a forest plot of the data using the function "forest()".


```



```{r ex1_4_3-hint}
# Create a forest plot of the data using the function "forest".
neurobehFor <- forest(
  neurobehMA,                                   # specify the meta-analysis to plot
  sortvar = TE,                                 # sort the data according to effect size
  comb.fixed = FALSE,                           # do not plot the fixed effect estimate
  comb.random = TRUE,                           # plot the random effects estimate
  leftlabs = c("Study", "ESi", "SEi"),                           # specify the labels for the left hand plot columns
  xlab = "NMD (% improvement in neurobehavioural outcomes)", # specify the x axis label
  smlab = "NMD",                                # specify the effect size label
  label.right = "Favours IL-1RA",               # specify the graph label on right side of plot
  label.left = "Favours Control",               # specify the graph label on left side of plot
  xlim = c(-150,150),                           # specify the x axis limits
  fontsize = 10,                                # specify the size of text (in points)
  plotwidth = "10cm",                           # specify the width of the plotting region
  digits = 1,                                   # specify minimal number of significant digits for treatment effects
  digits.se = 1                                 # specify minimal number of significant digits for standard errors
)
```

```{r quiz1_4_1, echo=FALSE}

# Questions:
# 
 ## - What effect does IL-1RA treatment have on neurobehavioural outcomes after stroke?
 ## - How much heterogeneity is in the data set?
  
quiz(caption = "Question:",
  question("What effect does IL-1RA treatment have on neurobehavioural outcomes after stroke?",
    answer("Treatment with IL-1RA improves neurobehavioural outcomes overall but there is high heterogeneity in the data set that should be explored further", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Treatment with IL-1RA significantly improves neurobehavioural outcomes with low heterogeneity in the data set"),
    answer("Treatment with IL-1RA has no effect on neurobehavioural outcomes but there is high heterogeneity in the data set"),
    answer("Treatment with IL-1RA results in highly heterogeneous effects and worsens outcome overall"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ))
```



Now you can select some variables to investigate as possible sources of heterogeneity using the function "metareg" e.g. species, sex, dose, time of administration, route of drug delivery, use of comorbid animals, method of induction of ischaemia, type of ischaemia, anaesthetic used, time of assessment, single vs. multiple administrations.

Remember that the variable name you use in your meta-regression model must match the column name in the data sheet exactly. To see a list of all the column names, you can use the function "colnames":
```{r ex1_4_4, fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 8, out.width="100%", out.height="100%", scaled = TRUE, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_4_2_setup", exercise.lines=30}
# use the metareg() function


```

```{r ex1_4_4-hint-1}

# check the names of all the columns in the data set
colnames(neurobeh)

```

```{r ex1_4_4-hint-2}

# check the different levels of the variable and number of experiments in each
table(neurobeh$Species)

neurobehSpecies <- metareg(
  
  # specify the meta-analysis
  neurobehMA,   
  
  # specify the experimental variable of interest
  ~ factor(Species)   
)   

# view the results of the meta-regression
neurobehSpecies 
```

```{r quiz1_4_2, echo=FALSE}

quiz(caption = "Questions:",
  question("Which variables are significant sources of heterogeneity (p-value < 0.05) and which are not?",
    answer("Significant: number of doses, route of drug delivery, and sex of the animals; non-significant: species, time of administration", correct = TRUE),

```


## 4.  Small study effects

Small study effects in meta-analysis can be assessed using a funnel plot, which is a scatter plot of individual study effect sizes against a measure of each study's precision. Ideally, the plot should approximately resemble a symmetrical (inverted) funnel. If there is bias due to missing results, for example because smaller studies without statistically significant effects remain unpublished, this will lead to asymmetry in the appearance of the funnel plot.

In this exercise, we will use the complete infarct volume data set and meta-analysis from the [first section of this tutorial.]{#set-up}

First, draw a funnel plot using the function "funnel": 

```{r ex2_1, scaled = TRUE, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3"}
infarctVolFun <- funnel(
 # specify the meta-analysis to plot
 infarctVolMA,  
 
 # plot the random effects estimate
 comb.random = TRUE,  
 
 # specify the x axis label
 xlab = "NMD (% reduction in infarct volume)",  
 
 # specify the measure plotted on the y axis, "invse" = inverse of the standard error
 yaxis = "se"   
)

# infarctVolFun
```

```{r quiz2_4_2, echo=FALSE}

# Examine the funnel plot and answer the following questions:
# 
# * What does the short-dash vertical line represent?
# * What do the longer-dash vertical and curved lines represent?
# * Are the studies distributed symmetrically around the summary estimate?
# * If there is asymmetry, where are studies "missing"? What might be a reason for this?
  
quiz(caption = "Examine the funnel plot and answer the following questions:",
  question("What does the short-dash vertical line represent?",
    answer("The pooled random effects estimate", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The pooled fixed effect estimate"),
    answer("The line of no effect"),
    answer("The funnel axis of symmetry"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("What do the longer-dash vertical and diagonal lines represent?",
    answer("The idealised funnel-shape that we expect our studies to follow and the average effect size", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The 95% confidence interval of where the studies should fall"),
    answer("The funnel-shape indicating the limits of where studies should fall"),
    answer("The pooled fixed effect estimate and 95% confidence interval"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Are the studies distributed symmetrically around the summary estimate?",
    answer("No, there are more studies with higher effect sizes and small standard errors than studies with lower effect sizes and small standard errors", correct = TRUE),
    answer("No, there are more studies with lower effect sizes and low standard errors than any other study"),
    answer("Yes, the studies with low standard errors are distributed fairly evenly around the summary effect"),
    answer("No, the distribution of studies looks nothing like a funnel"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("If there is asymmetry, what might be a reason for \"missing\" studies?",
    answer("Missing studies on the bottom right of the plot might be due to the fact that small studies with small or negative effects often remain unpublished"),
    answer("Missing studies on the top left of the plot might be due to the fact that studies with small or negative effects sometimes remain unpublished", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Studies might be missing from the top left of the plot because they have small sample sizes so are probably unpublished pilot studies"),
    answer("Studies might be missing from the bottom right of the plot because large effects sizes are rarely associated with large standard errors"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```


### Funnel plot asymmetry

In addition to assessing the funnel plot visually, we can test for asymmetry statistically. Here we will use Egger's test, based on a weighted linear regression of the treatment effect on its standard error.


Test for funnel plot asymmetry using the function "meta-bias":
```{r ex2_2, scaled = TRUE, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3"}
infarctVolBias <- metabias(
 # specify the meta-analysis to analyse
 infarctVolMA,  
 
 # specify the method behind the test statistic
 method.bias = "Egger", 
 
 # plot the results
 plotit = TRUE  
)  
        
# view the results of the funnel plot asymmetry analysis
infarctVolBias  
```




```{r quiz2_4_3, echo=FALSE}

# Questions:
#  
# * Is there statistical evidence of funnel plot asymmetry using Egger's regression?
  
quiz(caption = "Question",
  question("Is there statistical evidence of funnel plot asymmetry using Egger's regression?",
    answer("Yes", correct = TRUE),
    answer("No", correct = FALSE),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```




### Trim and fill 

We can also estimate and adjust for the number and outcomes of theoretically missing studies in a meta-analysis, using a method called **trim and fill**. 
We can test for and impute missing studies using the function "trimfill":

```{r ex2_3, scaled = TRUE, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3", exercise.lines=16}
infarctVolTrim <- trimfill(
  # specify the meta-analysis to plot
  infarctVolMA,
  
  # specify the side of the plot where missing studies are expected
  left = TRUE,  
  
  # plot the random effects estimate
  comb.random = TRUE,  
  
  # specify which method is used to estimate the between-study variance Ï„^2, restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimator
  method.tau = "REML"  
)           

# view the results of the trim-and-fill analysis
infarctVolTrim  
```

<br>

Draw a funnel plot of the filled data using the function "funnel":

```{r ex2_4, scaled = TRUE, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_1_setup_3", exercise.lines=10}
infarctVolTrimFun <- funnel(infarctVolTrim,
  # plot the random effects estimate
  comb.random = TRUE,  
  
  # specify the x axis label
  xlab = "NMD (% reduction in infarct volume)", 
  
  # specify the measure plotted on the y axis, "invse" = inverse of the standard error
  yaxis = "se"  
)
```

```{r quiz2_4_4, echo=FALSE}

# Questions:
# 
# * According to the trim and fill analysis, are there studies missing from the data set? 
#   * If yes, how many?
# * What is the adjusted random effects summary estimate when these theoretically missing studies are included in the meta-analysis?
# * What happens to the heterogeneity estimates when missing studies are added?
# * When taken together, what do the results of our funnel plot-based analyses tell us about the available data for infarct volume outcomes after treatment with IL-1RA?
# * What are some possible reasons for these results?
  
quiz(caption = "Questions:",
  question("According to the trim and fill analysis, are there studies missing from the data set?",
    answer("Yes, 30 studies", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Yes, 106 studies"),
    answer("Yes, 105 studies"),
    answer("No missing studies were detected"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("What is the adjusted random effects summary estimate and 95% CI when these theoretically missing studies are included in the meta-analysis?",
    answer("21.73, [15.97; 27.49]", correct = TRUE),
    answer("25.22, [20.71; 30.56]"),
    answer("-2.46, [20.26; 25.67]"),

    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("What happens to the heterogeneity estimates when missing studies are added?",
    answer("The estimates of heterogeneity have increased and remain significant", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The estimates of heterogeneity have decreased and remain significant"),
    answer("The estimates of heterogeneity have decreased and are no longer significant"),
    answer("The estimates of heterogeneity have not changed"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),

    answer("The analyses give diverging results and we cannot confirm anything about the available data"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),

```


## 5.  Test your skills: small study effects

We have now explored the code to assess and visaulise small study effects in the context of systematic review and meta-analysis. 

Next you will use our neurobehavioural data to create a funnel plot, test for asymmetry, and impute missing studies using the "funnel, "metabias", and "trimfill" functions. In part **3. Test your skills: meta-analysis** we used only those experiments where IL-1RA was administered in protein form and motor / sensory outcomes were assessed. To assess for small study effects, we will use the entire neurobehavioural data set.

We have provided the first part of the code to load the data and perform the meta-analysis. Start by writing code to create a funnel plot visualising these data:

```{r ex1_5_setup, include = FALSE}
neurobeh2 <- read.csv("IL1-RA_Neurobehaviour_Prenest_Part1.5.csv", fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")

neurobehMA2 <- metagen(
  # specify the variable that contains the effect size for each 
  # experiment 
  ESi,  
 
  # specify the variable that contains the standard error for each 
  # experiment
  SEi,  
  
  # specify the data set
  data = neurobeh2,  
  
  # specify a random effects model
  comb.random = TRUE,  

  # specify which method is used to estimate the between-study 
  # variance Ï„^2, restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimator
  method.tau = "REML",  
)


```

```{r ex2_5_1, fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 8, out.width="100%", out.height="100%", scaled = TRUE, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_5_setup", exercise.lines=40}

# first, load the data set "IL1-RA_Neurobehaviour_Prenest_Part1.5.csv" using the function read.csv().
neurobeh2 <- read.csv("IL1-RA_Neurobehaviour_Prenest_Part1.5.csv", fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")

# perform a random effects meta-analysis using the function "metagen".
neurobehMA2 <- metagen(
  ESi,  
  SEi,  
  data = neurobeh2,  
  comb.random = TRUE,
  comb.fixed = FALSE,
  method.tau = "REML"  
)
# view the results of the meta-analysis
neurobehMA2





# use the funnel() function to generate a funnel plot and visually assess the plot for asymmetry

```



```{r ex2_5_1-hint}
neurobehFun <- funnel(
 # specify the meta-analysis to plot
 neurobehMA2,  
 
 # plot the random effects estimate
 comb.random = TRUE,  
 
 # specify the x axis label
 xlab = "NMD (% improvement in neurobehavioural outcome)",  
 
 # specify the measure plotted on the y axis, "se" = inverse of the standard error
 yaxis = "se"   
)
```

Next, use Egger's test to assess funnel plot symmetry statistically:

```{r ex2_5_2, fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 8, out.width="100%", out.height="100%", scaled = TRUE, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_5_setup", exercise.lines=20}

# use the metabias() function to test for funnel plot asymmetry 




```


```{r ex2_5_2-hint}
neurobehBias <- metabias(
 # specify the meta-analysis to analyse
 neurobehMA2,  
 
 # specify the method behind the test statistic
 method.bias = "Egger", 
 
 # plot the results

Now use trim and fill to assess whether there are any theoretically missing studies in the data set and then create a funnel plot of the results:

```{r ex2_5_3, fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 8, out.width="100%", out.height="100%", scaled = TRUE, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1_5_setup", exercise.lines=35}

# use the trimfill() function to test for "missing" studies


















# use the funnel() function to plot the filled data set 

```

```{r ex2_5_3-hint-1}
neurobehTrim <- trimfill(
  # specify the meta-analysis to assess
  neurobehMA2,
  
  # specify the side of the plot where missing studies are expected
  left = TRUE,  
  
  # plot the random effects estimate
  comb.random = TRUE,  
  
  # specify which method is used to estimate the between-study variance Ï„^2, restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimator
  method.tau = "REML"  
)         

# view the results of the trim-and-fill analysis
neurobehTrim 
```

```{r ex2_5_3-hint-2}
neurobehTrimFun <- funnel(neurobehTrim,
  # plot the random effects estimate
  comb.random = TRUE,  
  
  # specify the x axis label
  xlab = "NMD (% improvement in neurobehavioural outcome)", 
  
  # specify the measure plotted on the y axis, "se" = inverse of the standard error
  yaxis = "se"  
)
```

```{r quiz2_4_5, echo=FALSE}

# Questions:
# 
# * What do the results of the analyses for small study effects tell us about the neurobehavioural data set?
  
quiz(caption = "Question:",
  question("What do the results of the analyses for small study effects tell us about the neurobehavioural data set?",
    answer("There is statistically significant evidence for funnel plot asymmetry and missing studies in the data set but the overall efficacy of IL-1RA is not changed greatly when these missing studies are added", correct = TRUE),
